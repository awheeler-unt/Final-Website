		<h2> <a name="Gameplay">Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
			<i>DREDGE</i> is an open world fishing game where you collect fish and items to complete quests for individuals, sell items for money,
			upgrade your boat and discover the mysteries of the world you are in while traveling between unique and unusual islands each 
			containing a story in its waters. Through tips from the residents from across the map you are given guide on how to complete certain 
			tasks and missiond to achieve.
		</p>
		<p>
			The controls of the game on keyboard follow a standard WASD format for movement with the mouse used to turn the camera. There is 
			also "F" key to interact with most items, "Tab" to open storage menu, and "E" to select different ablities. Other hotkeys to 
			streamline interaction are included, but the previously mentioned are the most basic. Overall the controls, are realitivly simple 
			to follow and since most items can be accessed through the "Tab" menu memorizing the hotkeys, although useful is not necessary. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Considering the controls as well as the low stakes, the game is quite easy to pick up and beginner friendly. The only the time 
			concern in the game is the possiblity of the fish onboard rotting, but the main missons and side quests can be completed at the 
			player's leisure without time restrictions. The concern of fish rotting is quelled by the inclusion of multiple fishing spots for 
			most fish and most fish will respawn after a cetain period of time. The exception to both of these in the main download of the game
			is the exotic fish. However, these fish are not a requirement for any quest.
		</p>
		<p>
			A penalty to consider is damaging your ship in the game by running into rocks or getting attacked. The repairs, although cheap can
			build up overtime. Luckily the game provides several places across all the islands to repair your ship and if you are strapped for 
			cash "Repair Mode" allows the player to repair the most necessary parts of the boat without spending all their money. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most interesting features of the game is the sanity mechanic or panic meter, a consequence for staying out too late after 
			dark, direct encounters with sea monsters, or using certain abilities. The panic meter is measured from 0-4 with 0 being completely
			and 4 being the highest form of panic. As panic increases unusual things begin to occur. First visably decreases around the edges of
			the screen making navigation more difficult. Then obstacles, ship, and strange creatures appear. More creatures and obstacles begin to
			show up becoming more horiffying and aggressive, blocking your movements and vision. Altogether, the panic meter is something to keep 
			in mind when playing and for the most part avoiding triggering it simply requires avoiding fishing at night. Thankfully, if the panic 
			has set in, staying near the lights of ports or fishing during the daytime will slowly return the panic to normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>DREDGE</i> with its relatively easy to learn controls and minimal punishments that can be quickly recovered from. Allows players 
			to take their time learning about the complex and interesting world. Although there are horror elements within the game, there is no
			pressure placed on the player to face these elements directly. There is time for the player to take a break and recover without 
			consequence.

			Opening the game, a fisherman traveling across open waters after getting a job listing for "Angler Wanted". Unfortunately, the 
			fisherman crashes into the rocky shore of the Marrows not seeing the lighthouse. Upon waking the next morning, the fisherman finds 
			himself on the docks of the Greater Marrow, the island he was headed for. His boat is damaged beyond repair, but the mayor of the 
			town has the the locals retrieve the fisherman's things and gives him a old boat. The mayor encourages the fisherman to begin his job 
			but leaves him with a warning to return before dark. After this introduction, the player can complete a variety of pursuits, such as
			discovering the locations rare fish, collecting lost teasures, or simply exploring.
