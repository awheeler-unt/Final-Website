		<h2> <a name="Gameplay">Gameplay </h2>
		<p>
			<i>DREDGE</i> is an open world fishing game where you collect fish and items to complete quests for individuals, sell items for money,
			upgrade your boat and discover the mysteries of the world you are in while traveling between unique and unusual islands each 
			containing a story in its waters. Through tips from the residents from across the map you are given guide on how to complete certain 
			tasks and missions to achieve.
		</p>
		<p>
			The controls of the game on keyboard follow a standard WASD format for movement with the mouse used to turn the camera. There is 
			also "F" key to interact with most items, "Tab" to open storage menu, and "E" to select different abilities. Other hotkeys to 
			streamline interaction are included, but the previously mentioned are the most basic. Overall the controls, are relaitivly simple 
			to follow and since most items can be accessed through the "Tab" menu memorizing the hotkeys, although useful is not necessary. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Considering the controls as well as the low stakes, the game is quite easy to pick up and beginner friendly. The only the time 
			concern in the game is the possibility of the fish onboard rotting, but the main missions and side quests can be completed at the 
			player's leisure without time restrictions. The concern of fish rotting is quelled by the inclusion of multiple fishing spots for 
			most fish and most fish will respawn after a certain period of time. The exception to both of these in the main download of the game
			is the exotic fish. However, capturing these fish are not a requirement for any quest.
		</p>
		<p>
			A penalty to be consider is damaging your ship in the game by running into rocks or getting attacked. The repairs, although cheap can
			build up overtime. Luckily the game provides several places across all the islands to repair your ship and if you are strapped for 
			cash "Repair Mode" allows the player to repair the most necessary parts of the boat without spending all their money. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most interesting features of the game is the sanity mechanic or panic meter, a consequence for staying out too late after 
			dark, direct encounters with sea monsters, or using certain abilities. The panic meter is measured from 0-4 with 0 being completely
			and 4 being the highest form of panic. As panic increases unusual things begin to occur. First, visibility decreases around the edges of
			the screen making navigation more difficult. Then obstacles, ship, and strange creatures appear. More creatures and obstacles begin to
			show up becoming more horrifying and aggressive, blocking your movements and vision. Altogether, the panic meter is something to keep 
			in mind when playing and for the most part avoiding triggering it simply requires avoiding fishing at night. Thankfully, if the panic 
			has set in, staying near the lights of ports or fishing during the daytime will slowly return the panic to normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>DREDGE</i> with its relatively easy to learn controls and minimal punishments, that can be quickly recovered from, allows players 
			to take their time learning about the complex and interesting world. Although there are horror elements within the game, there is no
			pressure placed on the player to face these elements directly. There is time for the player to take a break and recover without 
			consequence.

		<h2> <a name="Narrative">Narrative </h2>
		<p>
			Opening the game, a fisherman traveling across open waters after getting a job listing for "Angler Wanted". Unfortunately, the 
			Fisherman crashes into the rocky shore of the Marrows not seeing the lighthouse. Upon waking the next morning, the Fisherman finds 
			himself on the docks of the Greater Marrow, the island he was headed for. His boat is damaged beyond repair, but the mayor of the 
			town has the locals retrieve the Fisherman's things and gives him a old boat. The Mayor encourages the Fisherman to begin his job 
			but leaves him with a warning to return before dark. After this introduction, the player can complete a variety of pursuits, such as
			discovering the locations rare fish, collecting lost treasures, or simply exploring.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main plot <i>DREDGE</i> requires several steps to complete and follows the interactions between three characters: the Lighthouse
			Keeper, the Collecter on Blackstone Island, and the player character the Fisherman. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Fisherman first meets the Lighthouse Keeper who is wary of the newcomer and says "there is nothing here for someone like you anymore". 
			The interaction implies either she has an issue Fisherman or something else about the angler makes her uncomfortable. Throughout the game 
			she maintains this suspicion of the character, but oddly enough consistently gives warnings to the fisherman telling him he shouldn't be 
			meddling around. Much to the dismay of the Lighthouse Keeper continuing the story requires ignoring most of her requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			The collector appears after selling an Aberration to the Fishmonger, the Fishmonger dissects the fish then gives a handkerchief and sends 
			the angler on his way. The Collector overhears this conversation and asks the Fisherman to meet him at Blackstone Isle. After meeting with 
			him the Collector offers the equipment to dredge up shipwrecks in exchange for the handkerchief. Upon accepting, not that there's much 
			choice, he give a list of items for the fisherman to retrieve on his behalf. Each item can be found at a different island across the map and 
			with each item retrieved the Collector he gives the Fisherman a new ability to help him on his journeys.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first item to find is the Ornate Key found in the Morrows. Once retrieved, the Collector will be upset that the music box didn't come 
			with it, but will still reward you with the ability Haste, that allows the boat's speed to be increase, however, it also can damage the engines 
			and increase Panic. Visiting the after getting the ability the Lighthouse Keeper says the engine sounded familiar and she mistook it for a 
			different boat of an old friend.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next relic is located in Gale Cliffs. After helping two brothers make amends and reunite the Music Box can be retrieved. Returning it to 
			the Collector he'll give the ability Manifest which teleports the ship from any location to the cove of Blackstone Isle. There is a cool down 
			period for this ability and it also increases panic. Talking to the Lighthouse Keeper she'll tell the Fisherman crossing the ocean like that is 
			"tempting fate" and says "things are bad enough without your provocations".
		</p>
		<p>
			With the help of the Research Assistant at Stellar Basin to quell the monster of the island, the fishermen can retrieve the Jewel Encrusted Band. 
			Giving this to the Collector he gives you the ability Banish that dispels all Panic related attacks and repel monsters after your vessel. This 
			ability has a cooldown and again does increase panic. Stopping at the Marrow the Lighthouse Keeper she asks if you have found what you are looking 
			for and will response differently depending on what you say.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get the Shimmering Necklace in Twisted Strand the Fisherman helps the Airman kill the Mind Suckers and the Airman retrieves the necklace from 
			one of their corpses. returning to the Collector he rewards you with the Atrophy ability allowing for the harvesting of all fish in the area in an 
			instant. There is a cooldown and panic increase just like other abilites. Going back to the Marrows the Lighthouse Keeper doesn't say anything,
			although there is now an option to ask about the Old Mayor.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2> <a name="Endings">Endings </h2>
		<p>
			There are two endings for <i>DREDGE</i> one where you follow through with the Collector's request and the other is taking the relics from the 
			Collector giving them to the Old Mayor. The former is considered the bad ending and the latter is considered the good/secret ending.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first ending follows the main story clearly after retrieving all the items the Collector tells the Fisherman to take all the relics and wait 
			for dark. With this the two set out  toward the red light in the middle of the ocean where the Collector says "this is where she was taken from 
			us and where we can bring her back" Following a ritual of throwing all the relics into the ocean one after another the Fisherman and Collector 
			revive the Dead Wife. Unfortunately a eldritch creature also appears out of the sea summoning storms with it. The perspective turns to the town 
			located on the Marrows completely destroyed and on fire.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the good ending, after stealing the relics from the Collector the Fisherman goes to the Old Mayor, giving him all the relics. The Mayor 
			instructs him to go to the Lighthouse Keeper who gives him the context of the mutating fish and horrors of the waters being cause by the <i>Book 
			of the Deep</i> that the Collector has. After this the Fisherman goes to visit the Collector to demand the book only to realize the Collector 
			has been his reflection in a mirror all along. Returning to the Lighthouse Keeper she tells him to throw the book into the sea and guides him 
			with her lighthouse to the place to do it. After a struggle between the Fisherman and the book he manages to throw it. As it sinks down the boat 
			is swallowed by a giant sea monster. The perspective turns to the town where all is normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			In both of these endings it is implied that the Fisherman and the Collector are one in the same. Although in the game it is chalked up to being 
			the influence of the book, it brings interesting ideas about grief and loss. After the Fisherman's loss he continues doing the only thing he knows 
			but is still subconsciously plagued by his grief unable to let it go. His alter self the collector compels him to revive his wife. In the bad 
			ending he succeeds, but ends up destroying the town in the process. In the good ending the town survives, but the Fisherman is killed by a monster 
			in the process. These bring up to interesting ideas of loss, in both the fisherman ends up with his wife alive or dead. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The first ending tackles the moral question of bring a loved one back from the dead. If it was possible would you do it? And what consequences are 
			you willing to face because of it? In this instance, the Fisherman chooses his wife over the well being of an entire town. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The second ending considers if life without an individual is even worth living. If they were such an important part of your life, can you truly 
			live without them? Although the Fisherman doesn't actively commit suicide, he is killed after giving up his only way to see his wife. A symbolic 
			suicide if you will. He ends up dead along side his lover in the end. based on his choices even if that wasn't his intent. A previous comment form 
			the Lighthouse Keeper, when she implies sailing out to sea recklessly is dangerous, confirms this.
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2> <a name="Conclusion">Conclusion </h2>
		<p>
			Tying <i>DREDGE</i> to topics of this class one to consider in the aspects of Play demonstrated by Lindley. The major question about the game 
			is to know who the Fisherman is and what his goals are. In the beginning, it feels like a standard open world RPG where the player character's 
			actions are determined by the other characters around them. But it is discovered later that the Collector who is a literal reflection of the 
			Fisherman and control most of the progress of the story. This character driven focus is enforced by the simplistic gameplay and low stakes. The 
			game itself is not meant to be difficult giving more focus to the actual character stories. This works into human curiosity to learn more about 
			each other and the instinct to understand each other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Something else to note is the connection between Lucan's Mirror. The Fisherman is like the player because he acts in their interests, the 
			characters the players want to interact with he will interact with. The places the player wants to explore he will explore. However the 
			Fisherman is not the player he has his own backstory, motivations, and faults. Although the player can control some aspects of his actions, 
			ultimately the Fisherman is following his own journey that players get to witness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another aspect of the game involves the "reality effects" is the inclusion of ordinary sea creatures alongside the horrifying monsters in the 
			game. When traveling across the map you can see whales and dolphins. This considers that without the effects of the <i>Book of the Deep</i> 
			this world was originally ordinary. To expand on this the fish species that can be caught are real species from reality. This make it all the 
			more horrifying when mutated versions of them appear. It also connects the player further to the character because rather than an unusual world, 
			it is a regular world that has been tainted and these characters are ordinary people trying to survive.
		</p>
		<p>
			All this to say, <i>DREDGE</i> is entertaining for a variety of reason. Although the gameplay is not particularly challenging, the tasks to 
			complete are varied enough to keep it interesting. It could be argued that the appeal of <i>DREDGE</i> is not meant to be the gameplay but the 
			stories of the individuals and their interactions that make the game compelling. It gives the world of <i>DREDGE</i> a lived feeling with 
			characters who have genuine desires driven by guilt, curiosity, revenge, and fear. They make mistakes, fail, hurt, and care, which creates a 
			drive to want to learn more about them what they have gone through and what they plan on doing. At the end of the day, the people in <i>DREDGE</i>
			are ordinary and that connection to the ordinary creates a appealing story for players to experience.
